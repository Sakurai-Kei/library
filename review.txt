What does this web do?
-It lets users to save information about a book using objects. The website
    then display the books information. User can also delete books saved. Ideally, 
    data can be stored either locally or cloud.

Problems encountered?
-(Problems will be listed here, alongside with how I problem solve them)
-I forgot to link the script file and wondered for an hour why my script wasn't working
-Having trouble with making the modal window where I could not position it in the middle.
    First attempt to fix it was to make it positioned in the middle but it made the
    bottom half of the modal window dim while the uppder half looks normal. Second attempt
    is by simply declaring flex display instead of block.
-Input field not resetting after submit. This is solved by declaring textContent of the
    field to be "" so the placeholder would appear.
-I have problem when trying to solve the problem of deleting object in myLibrary.
    I went through the long way, extracting the selected book from myLibrary, then attempted
    find the index of it in myLibrary. It took me a while that I
    do not have to do this. Instead, I solved it by simply applying
    filter() method with !== condition, which then declare myLibrary = array produced
    from filter method, therefore the new myLibrary is now whatever book which was
    not selected.
-User were able to choose which book to delete even though the function has ended.
